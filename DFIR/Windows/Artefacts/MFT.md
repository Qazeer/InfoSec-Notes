# DFIR - Windows - Master File Table (MFT)

**Windows DFIR notes are no longer maintained on InfoSec-Notes. Updated versions can be found on: [artefacts.help](https://artefacts.help/).**

### Overview

The `Master File Table (MFT)`, filename `$MFT`, is the main element of any
`New Technology File System (NTFS)` partition. The `Partition Boot Sector`
`$Boot` metadata file, which starts at sector 0 and can be up to 16 sectors
long, describes the basic `NTFS` volume information and indicates the location
of the `$MFT`.

The `MFT` contains an entry for all existing files written on the partition.
Deleted files that were once written on the partition may also (temporally)
still have a `file record` in the `MFT`.

Each `file record` in the `MFT` notably includes:
  - The filename.

  - The file size.

  - The file unique (under the `NTFS` volume) `Security ID` in the
    `$STANDARD_INFORMATION` attribute.

  - The file creation, last modified, last accessed, and last changed `SI`
    timestamps in the `$STANDARD_INFORMATION` attribute.

  - The file creation, last modified, last accessed, and last changed `FN`
    timestamps in the `$FILE_NAME` attribute.

  - Whether the `file record` is in use. When a file is deleted from the
    volume, its associated `MFT` `file record` is set as no longer in use, but
    is not directly deleted during the file deletion process. Metadata
    information, and content for `MFT` resident files, can thus be retrieved
    for recently deleted files (as long as the `file record` is not overwritten
    by a new entry).

The `$MFT` file has both the `Hidden (H)` and `System (S)` attributes and will
thus not be shown by the Windows Explorer application or the `dir` utility by
default.

###### $Bitmap

The `$Bitmap` file tracks the allocation status (allocated or unused) of the
clusters of the volume. Each cluster is associated with a bit, set to `0x1` if
the cluster is in use.

Upon deletion of a non resident file, the `$Bitmap` file is updated to tag the
cluster(s) associated with the file as free. The clusters are not overwritten
during the deletion process, and the file data can thus be carved as long as
the cluster(s) are not re-used.

###### $Secure

The `$Secure` file contains the `security descriptor` for all the files and
folders on a `NTFS` volume. The `security descriptors` are stored within the
`$SDS` named data stream of the `$Secure` file. The `$Secure` file additionally
defines two other named streams (`$SDH` and `$SII`) for lookup in the `$SDS`
stream.

Each file or folder is referenced in the `$Secure` file with its volume-unique
`Security ID` and `security descriptor`. The `Security ID` of the file is
referenced in the `MFT` file record associated with the file (in the
`$STANDARD_INFORMATION` attribute). While no metadata information are present
in the `$Secure` file (only the file's `security descriptor`), the file's
`Security ID` can be used to map the file's information / data from the `MFT`
to its `security descriptor` in the `$Secure` file.

The `security descriptor` (`SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR` data structure) references:
  - The owner of the file (as a pointer to a `SID` structure).
  - The access rights to the file in the
    `Discretionary Access Control List (DACL)` attribute.
  - The audit rights that control how access is audited (which access will
    generate events) in the `System Access Control List (SACL)` attribute.

###### $LogFile

The `$LogFile` is part of a journaling feature of `NTFS`, activated by default,
which maintains a low-level record of changes made to the `NTFS` volume.
Every disk operation is journalized prior to being committed. In case of
failure, such as a crash during an update, the `$LogFile` can be used to revert
disk operations. As low-level operations are journalized, the `$LogFile`
contains very limited historical data, usually only of the last few hours at
most.

###### $STANDARD_INFORMATION vs $FILE_NAME

The `$STANDARD_INFORMATION` and `$FILE_NAME` attributes are updated
differently for the same file action. The changes produced on the attributes
for a file creation, access, modification, renaming, etc. can be found on the
[SANS `Windows Forensic Analysis` poster](https://www.sans.org/security-resources/posters/windows-forensic-analysis/170/download).

`[DFIR] Windows - Timestamps` note.

### Parsing

###### MFTECmd

The `MFTECmd` utility can parse and extract information from the `$MFT` (as
well as other filesystem artefacts such as the `UsnJrnl`'s `$J` stream, the
file ownership `$Secure:$SDS` data stream, and the transaction log file
`$Logfile`).

```bash
# A $MFT file on a mounted partition should be specified.
# For instance, to extract $MFT data from a forensics image, the image should first be mounted and the $MFT specified as <DRIVER_LETTER:\$MFT to MFTECmd.exe.

MFTECmd.exe -f '<$MFT_FILE>' --csv <OUTPUTDIR_PATH>
```

###### Mft2Csv

The [`Mft2Csv`](https://github.com/jschicht/Mft2Csv) utility can parse, decode,
and log information from the MFT to a CSV. It supports getting the `$MFT` from
a variety of sources and notably:
  - a raw/dd image of disk or partition
  - an extracted `$MFT` file
  - a live host

Note that `Mft2Csv` can only output in one format at a time.

```bash
# Get machine time zone
tzutil /g

# Opens a GUI
Mft2Csv.exe

# Command line
# UTC + 1
Mft2Csv.exe /Volume:<NTFS_VOLUME> /OutputPath:"<OUTPUT_FOLDER>" /OutputFormat:all /TimeZone:"<-12.00 ... 14.00>" /Separator:"<CSV_SEPARATOR>"
Mft2Csv.exe /MftFile:<MFT_FILE> /OutputPath:"<OUTPUT_FOLDER>" /OutputFormat:all /TimeZone:"<-12.00 ... 14.00>" /Separator:"<CSV_SEPARATOR>"
```

`Mft2Csv` will produce a CSV containing all the MFT entries. To parse the CSV,
the Python utility `q` can be used to run SQL-like queries directly against
the CSV:

```bash
q -d '|' -H -O "SELECT FN_FileName,FilePath,FileSizeBytes,SI_FilePermission,SI_CTime,SI_ATime,SI_MTime,SI_RTime,FN_CTime,FN_ATime,FN_MTime,FN_RTime FROM <MFT_CSV_PATH> WHERE SI_CTime >= '<YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:SS.0000000>' AND SI_CTime < '<<YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:SS.9999999>' ORDER BY SI_CTime"
```

###### PowerShell PowerForensics Get-ForensicFileRecord

The PowerShell cmdlet `Get-ForensicFileRecord` of the `PowerForensics` suite
parses the `$MFT` file and returns an array of FileRecord entries. By default,
`Get-ForensicFileRecord` will parse the `$MFT` file on the C:\ drive.

`Get-ForensicFileRecord` can be used to retrieve record for a specified file.

```powershell
# Deploy the PowerShell PowerForensics module
.\PowerForensics.psd1
Import-Module .\PowerForensics.psd1

Get-ForensicFileRecord | Out-File <OUTPUT_FILE>
Get-ForensicFileRecord -VolumeName <NTFS_VOLUME> | Out-File <OUTPUT_FILE>
Get-ForensicFileRecord -MftPath <EXPORTED_MFT_PATH> | Out-File <OUTPUT_FILE>

Get-ForensicFileRecord -Path <FILE_TO_GET_RECORD_OF>
```
